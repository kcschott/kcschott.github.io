    "text": "I am a wildlife veterinarian and PhD student studying the disease ecology of leptospirosis in marine mammals and other coastal wildlife in the Lloyd-Smith lab at UCLA. My interest in disease ecology was sparked as an undergraduate at Princeton, where I researched the transmission of a protozoal parasite to sea otters for my senior thesis. I entered vet school at Cornell with the goal of combining clinical wildlife medicine with research to understand the underlying drivers of health and disease in my patientsâ€™ free-ranging populations. After several years pursuing specialty training in exotic companion animal and wildlife medicine, I returned to graduate school to get my PhD. Broadly, I am interested in the ecology of multi-host pathogens and the drivers of transmission across ecosystem boundaries, and I aspire to bridge the gap between clinical wildlife medicine and wildlife disease ecology by collaborating with wildlife rehabilitation centers to enhance their capacity to contribute to population-level health research.\nOutside of the lab and the clinic, I enjoy backpacking and completed a thruhike of the Appalachian Trail over the spring and summer prior to starting my PhD. I also enjoy rock climbing, paddling, dancing, and dabbling in wildlife photography and birding."
