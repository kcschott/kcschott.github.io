I am a wildlife veterinarian and PhD student studying the disease ecology of leptospirosis in marine mammals and other coastal wildlife in the Lloyd-Smith lab at UCLA. Broadly, I am interested in the ecology of multi-host pathogens and the drivers of transmission across ecosystem boundaries, and I aspire to bridge the gap between clinical wildlife medicine and wildlife disease ecology by collaborating with wildlife rehabilitation centers to enhance their capacity to contribute to population-level health research.
